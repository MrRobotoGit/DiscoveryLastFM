## [2.0.3] - 2025-06-25

### 🚨 Critical Lidarr Reliability Fixes

**Lidarr 503 Service Unavailable Resolution**
- **FIXED**: Lidarr timeout issues with artist/album lookup operations - implemented differentiated timeouts
- **FIXED**: Lidarr 503 Service Unavailable errors causing workflow failures - added specific 503 error handling
- **FIXED**: Insufficient retry delays for server overload scenarios - implemented exponential backoff strategy
- **FIXED**: Workflow blocking on persistent server issues - added graceful degradation with operation skipping

### 🔧 Enhanced Lidarr Service Layer

**Timeout Optimization**
- **NEW**: Differentiated timeout system - 300s for lookup operations, 120s for commands, 30s for status
- **NEW**: Operation-specific timeout mapping with automatic selection based on endpoint
- **NEW**: Debug logging shows timeout values used for each operation
- **IMPROVED**: Base timeout (60s) maintained for backward compatibility while extending heavy operations

**503 Error Handling & Recovery**
- **NEW**: Specific 503 Service Unavailable error detection and handling
- **NEW**: Exponential backoff for 503 errors (15s → 60s → 180s) to allow server recovery time
- **NEW**: Health-based operation skipping - automatically skip operations after 3+ recent 503 errors
- **NEW**: Server recovery detection - automatic reset of error counters when operations succeed
- **NEW**: Enhanced error messages with timing information and attempt context

### 📊 Advanced Performance Monitoring

**Lidarr-Specific Metrics**
- **NEW**: `server_unavailable_503` counter for tracking server overload events
- **NEW**: `health_status` indicator (healthy/degraded) based on recent 503 error count
- **NEW**: Per-operation timing with warnings for slow operations (>30s)
- **NEW**: Comprehensive performance stats in service info with recovery indicators
- **IMPROVED**: Request attempt logging with timeout values for enhanced debugging

### 🛡️ Resilience & Reliability

**Graceful Degradation**
- **NEW**: Automatic operation skipping when server health is degraded (3+ 503 errors)
- **NEW**: Workflow continuity - continues processing other artists when individual lookups fail
- **NEW**: Smart retry strategy with increased delays for lookup operations vs standard operations
- **NEW**: Server recovery awareness - resumes normal operations when server becomes healthy

**Enhanced Debugging & Diagnostics**
- **NEW**: Detailed timing information for all Lidarr operations
- **NEW**: Operation attempt tracking with timeout context
- **NEW**: Slow operation warnings with specific timing thresholds
- **NEW**: 503 error pattern detection and logging for server health analysis
